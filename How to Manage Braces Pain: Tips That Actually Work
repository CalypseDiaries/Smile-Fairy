Getting braces is a big step toward a healthier, straighter smile—but let’s be honest, the pain can catch you off guard. Whether it’s your first week with braces or a monthly adjustment, that dull ache or sharp soreness can make eating, sleeping, and even talking uncomfortable. The good news? You don’t have to suffer through it. There are real, practical ways to ease the discomfort—and no, you don’t need to be a dental ninja to do it.
Let’s break down the tips that actually work.
1. Over-the-Counter Relief (When Needed)
One of the easiest ways to manage braces pain is with a mild pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. These help reduce inflammation and take the edge off the soreness. Just be sure to follow the dosage instructions, and always check with your orthodontist if you’re unsure.
2. Orthodontic Wax is Your New BFF
That little box of wax your orthodontist gave you? It’s magic. If brackets or wires are rubbing against your cheeks or gums, a small piece of wax can create a smooth barrier that stops irritation in its tracks. Use it especially at night to help you sleep better without that nagging poke.
3. Saltwater Rinses: Simple but Soothing
Swishing with warm saltwater (a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water) can calm irritated tissues and speed up healing. Do this a few times a day, especially after eating. It’s a gentle, natural remedy that really works.
4. Stick to Soft Foods
The first few days after getting braces—or any adjustment—are not the time for crunchy chips or chewy bagels. Soft foods like mashed potatoes, soups, yogurt, smoothies, eggs, and pasta are your best bet. They’re easy on your teeth and give your mouth a break from all the pressure.
5. Cold Compresses and Ice Packs
Feeling sore around the jaw? Applying a cold compress on the outside of your face can help reduce swelling and numb the area. Even sucking on ice chips or eating something cold (like frozen yogurt) can soothe inside pain. Just avoid chewing hard ice!
6. Stay on Top of Oral Hygiene
It might sound unrelated, but keeping your mouth clean can actually reduce pain and prevent complications. Food stuck around brackets and wires can increase sensitivity and even lead to infections. So brush gently, floss carefully with special orthodontic tools, and rinse regularly.
7. Give It Time (and a Little Patience)
The truth is, some discomfort is part of the process. But it does get better. Your mouth will slowly adjust, and what felt intense in week one will be a distant memory later on. Just hang in there—your future smile is totally worth it.

Final Thoughts
Braces pain isn’t fun, but it is manageable. By combining smart home remedies, gentle care, and a little patience, you can get through the rough days with less discomfort—and more confidence. Remember, every twinge means you’re one step closer to the smile you’ve been dreaming of.
