If you’re searching for a discreet way to straighten your teeth, behind-the-teeth braces Long Beach CA might be the solution you’ve been looking for. Unlike traditional braces that are visible when you smile, behind-the-teeth braces—also known as lingual braces—are placed on the back of your teeth. This innovative approach makes them virtually invisible, giving you the confidence to straighten your smile without drawing attention to your orthodontic treatment.

What Are Behind-the-Teeth Braces?
Behind-the-teeth braces work similarly to traditional braces but with a key difference: they are attached to the inner surface of your teeth, facing your tongue. They use customized brackets and wires to gradually move teeth into the desired position. The biggest advantage? They remain hidden from view, which makes them a popular choice for adults and teens who want a subtle treatment option.

Who Can Benefit From Them?
Almost anyone who is a candidate for traditional braces can consider lingual braces. They are particularly appealing to adults in professional settings or teens concerned about appearance. That said, not every dental case is suitable. Patients with severe bite issues or very small teeth may require a different orthodontic approach. Your orthodontist in Long Beach, CA, can evaluate your teeth and determine if behind-the-teeth braces are right for you.

The Treatment Process
The journey with behind-the-teeth braces begins with a detailed consultation. Your orthodontist will take impressions of your teeth to create customized brackets that fit perfectly behind each tooth. Once placed, these braces gradually shift your teeth into proper alignment, typically over 12 to 36 months, depending on the complexity of your case. Regular check-ups ensure that your treatment is progressing as planned.

Pros and Cons
One of the biggest pros is invisibility. Lingual braces give the same results as traditional braces without affecting your smile during treatment. They also reduce the risk of visible staining on the front surfaces of teeth. However, some patients experience initial tongue discomfort, difficulty with speech, or a slightly longer adjustment period. Maintaining oral hygiene can be a bit more challenging, so diligent brushing and flossing are essential.

Is It Worth It?
For those who want a straight, confident smile without the appearance of braces, behind-the-teeth braces are definitely worth considering. With the right orthodontist in Long Beach, CA, you can enjoy a fully customized, nearly invisible solution that doesn’t compromise on effectiveness.
